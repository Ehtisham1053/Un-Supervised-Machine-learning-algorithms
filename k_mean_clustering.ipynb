        "## Definition\n",
        "K-Means is an **unsupervised machine learning algorithm** used to group data points into a predefined number of clusters (**K**) based on their similarity.  \n",
        "The algorithm partitions the dataset so that points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to points in other clusters.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## How It Works\n",
        "K-Means works by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster center (centroid) and then recalculating the centroids based on the mean of assigned points until convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Algorithm Steps**\n",
        "1. Choose the number of clusters, **K**.  \n",
        "2. Initialize **K centroids** randomly.  \n",
        "3. Assign each data point to the **nearest centroid**.  \n",
        "4. Update centroids by computing the **mean of all points** in each cluster.  \n",
        "5. Repeat steps 3–4 until centroids no longer change (or until a maximum number of iterations).\n",
